# -CryoET-Object-Identification-Advancing-3D-Protein-Complex-Annotation
Automated detection of protein complexes in cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) data. ML models identify five particle classes using a weighted F-β (β=4) metric focused on recall, especially for hard targets, helping reveal cellular “dark matter” and advance biological discovery.
